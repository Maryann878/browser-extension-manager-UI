## Project Overview

This project presents a modern and responsive UI layout for managing browser extensions. It displays a list of extensions, each with its logo, description, and activation status. The data is dynamically sourced from a `data.json` file and rendered using JavaScript.

---

## The challenge

Users can:

- Toggle extensions between active and inactive states
- Filter active and inactive extensions
- Remove extensions from the list
- Select their color theme
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
